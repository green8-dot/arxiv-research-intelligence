# Research Synthesis Project

Automated research intelligence gathering and NLP processing for scientific literature.

## Overview

Framework for automated research synthesis combining:
- Intelligent document retrieval
- NLP-based analysis (SciBERT embeddings)
- Graph-enhanced relationship discovery
- Evidence-based hypothesis generation

## Capabilities

### Document Retrieval
- Multi-source data collection (arXiv, PubMed, OpenAlex)
- Intelligent filtering by domain and relevance
- Automated metadata extraction

### NLP Analysis
- SciBERT semantic embeddings
- Topic modeling and clustering
- Research gap identification
- Cross-domain connection detection

### Graph Integration
- Leverage knowledge graph (135K papers)
- Citation network analysis
- Author expertise identification
- Research community mapping

## Applications

### Automated Literature Review
- Query: "What are effective treatments for X?"
- Output: Evidence-based summary with citation trails

### Research Gap Detection
- Identify under-explored research areas
- Find disconnected research communities
- Suggest collaboration opportunities

### Hypothesis Generation
- Cross-domain pattern detection
- Novel connection identification
- Evidence-weighted predictions
